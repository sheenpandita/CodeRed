The menstrual cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the female reproductive system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible The menstrual cycle occurs due to the rise and fall of estrogen. This cycle results in the thickening of the lining of the uterus, and the growth of an egg, (which is required for pregnancy). The egg is released from an ovary around day fourteen in the cycle; the thickened lining of the uterus provides nutrients to an embryo after implantation  If pregnancy does not occur, the lining is released in what is known as menstruation Many women experience painful cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, during menstruation Menstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle Several menstrual hygiene products exist for menstrual management.
